                        <p>The adaptation of SMART business goals and utilization of ISO has defined the repair process flow and the continual secure handling of electronic devices. Cynergy also uses forced routing for effective management of electronics throughout the repair and assembly processes. This eliminates process bottlenecks, allows for the forecasting of parts, and optimizes work schedules.<br/><br/>

                            Cynergy has a real-time locator for checkpoint control of each electronic device and identification of the person who has completed each required stage of the repair process. All this has earned Cynergy a well-deserved and respected reputation as a quality provider of repair services for electronic devices.
