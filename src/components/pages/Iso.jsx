                    <p>To better understand the customer and exceed their expectations, Cynergy assesses the current and future needs of the customers' requirements using the process approach to control the processes that make up the company. The Plan-Do-Check-Act model looks at the interactions between these processes, and the inputs and outputs that tie these processes together. As electronic technology continues to offer more features and services to consumers, we use a risk management process to improve activates and determine where improvements can make to most impact. Cynergy meets with customers frequently, to assess the current needs and any issues that may arise during production. To assure that only the highest quality product is used, only OEM provided components are used to refurbish units.<br/><br/>

                        All information about each device is collected and stored on our advanced IT system. Each day management looks at the data and then sets and monitors the production goals to ensure they are in line with the purpose and direction of the company and their customers.<br/><br/>
                        
                        The core of Cynergy is the people. Cynergy has a diverse workforce that has many unique abilities. Management will evaluate these abilities, and then they will place the individual into the most appropriate area. These individuals are more focused, present, and energized on the tasks given to them.</p>
